## Description:
Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—-and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.
As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

# Overview

## The Challenge:

As a user (with time blindness/ADHD)
I would like to see a visualization of my upcoming events
WHEN I log in to the page,
THEN I see my most pressing events graphically displayed, coloured based on the urgency of the event, and a list of my other, upcoming events
WHEN I create an event
THEN I am given the ability to set a category to define alert threshold periods
WHEN I click on the event
THEN I am given a calendar and the ability to add task events related to the event.

## User Story
